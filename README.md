- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
For some reason my app does not display the title or overview on the side but is below all the images. It can be seen if you scroll quickly enough. I believe this has to do with the item_movie.xml file but I couldn't figure our why.
